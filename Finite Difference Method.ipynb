    "Since we are dealing with vectors the next thing to consider, is how do the cylindrical coordinate unit vectors $\\hat{\\rho}$, $\\hat{\\phi}$ and $\\hat{z}$ project onto the rectilinear coordinate $\\hat{x}$, $\\hat{y}$, and $\\hat{z}$.  The remainder of this exercise will focus on 2 dimensions; only consider the $\\hat{\\rho}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$ projection onto the $\\hat{x}$, $\\hat{y}$ unit vectors.  The key to this discussion is that unlike $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$, $\\hat{\\rho}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$ are not constant unit vectors; they vary with location.  \n",
